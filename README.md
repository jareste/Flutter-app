# Flutter-app

On this project I was requested to do an android app on my prefered lenguaje to imitate an existing app they provided. As the offer was in flutter I decided to go with it.

The app it's a simple app that's doing api requests to get the products to show. I was also requested to:

- Generate a view for a concret product when clicking on it.
- Add a searchbar.
- Some ways to display as idOrder.
- A way to scan barcodes and search for an specific product.
- Whatever I wanted to add.

How I've done it:

First of all I've started by doing a working app that was doing all the time api request and directly show on screen the api response. Later I decided to store the products on the mobile storage in order to do less api petitions and also to be able to work and use the app without internet, this was a big improve.

I also decided to add some extra functionalities like a favourites list and a shopping cart where you can add products and remove them.
